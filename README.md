# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C#.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the `tic-tac-toe` directory.
4. Open a terminal and run the following command to build the project:
   ```
   dotnet build
   ```
5. Once the build is successful, run the following command to start the game:
   ```
   dotnet run --project tic-tac-toe.csproj
   ```

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players take turns marking a cell on the grid with their respective symbols (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
